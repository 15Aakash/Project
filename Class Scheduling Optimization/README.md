# Class Scheduling Optimization Using Integer Programming

This project presents a proposal for improving class scheduling efficiency at a large educational institution using Integer Programming techniques. The goal is to automate and optimize the scheduling process while considering constraints such as faculty availability, classroom capacities, and course requirements.

## Project Overview
Manual scheduling methods often result in conflicts, underutilized resources, and dissatisfaction among stakeholders. This proposal recommends the use of optimization modeling—specifically Integer Programming—to generate optimal schedules that align with institutional constraints and improve operational efficiency.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Optimization Technique:** Integer Programming  
- **Software Proposed:** Gurobi Optimizer  
- **Modeled Constraints:** Faculty availability, room capacity, time slots, course requirements  

## Objective
To demonstrate how optimization can:
- Reduce scheduling conflicts
- Improve room utilization
- Minimize manual scheduling effort
- Increase stakeholder satisfaction (faculty and students)

## Reference Article
The project draws inspiration from the article:  
**"Ohio University's College of Business Uses Integer Programming to Schedule Classes"**  
*INFORMS Journal on Applied Analytics, Nov-Dec 2004.*

## Metrics for Success
- Reduction in scheduling conflicts
- Improved classroom utilization rates
- Shorter scheduling cycle time
- Positive feedback from faculty/students via surveys

## Academic Context
This project was developed as part of the graduate curriculum in **Decision Analytics** at **Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU)**.

## Use of Generative AI
ChatGPT was used for brainstorming, content organization, and refinement under human oversight to enhance quality and maintain alignment with academic standards.
